# Research on Heap Structures Applications
Full research on implementing heap on real life applications to get the effective system of continuous back and forth passing of information(Digital) like human thoughts(Analog) in brain muscles

# Why it's Important?
This structure can enable the sophasticated trasnsfer of data (just like trasfer bus in MC and MP)with help of constrints or rule of passing. So, this can fasten the computation speed of an processor and we can espesiesly use this in high GPU and TPU hardwares or it can create new possible processor.
